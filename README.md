# code-quiz
This application is a short quiz about some coding concepts (HTML/CSS/JavaScript). 

## Installation
There is no installation necessary for this application. It can be accessed on any web browser at this url: https://killingsworth-kristen.github.io/code-quiz/

##Usage
On page load there is a link in the top left that can access the highscores page where all of the scores are stored locally. There is a start button that when clicked, brings up the first question and starts a timer. If the question is answered correcctly, it shows a correct text for one second. If the question is answered incorrectly, 15 seconds is removed from the timer and the correct answer is displayed for one second. Once all questions are answered or the timer runs out, there is a place to input your initials. When you submit the page, you are redirected to the highscore page and it updates with your new score. 

## Credits
I built this application from scratch. I utilized some emmet snippets in VS code to get some base structure for the HTML pages, but otherwise everything was applied from the content that I have been learning as part of the UW coding bootcamp course.
